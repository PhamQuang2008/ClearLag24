ClearLag24 is a server plugin designed to reduce lag on Bukkit/Spigot servers by automatically removing ground items (such as dropped items and experience orbs). It helps optimize server performance by periodically clearing these items. The plugin offers several features:

- **Automatic Item Clearing:** The plugin periodically removes items on the ground to prevent them from causing lag.
- **Customizable Settings:** You can configure the interval between item clears, specify which worlds to clear items in, and blacklist specific worlds or item types.
- **Reload Configuration:** Use `/clearlag24 reload` to reload the plugin's configuration from the `config.yml` file.
- **World-Specific Clearing:** Use `/clearlag24 clear <world>` to clear items in a specific world. Alternatively, `/clearlag24 clear all` clears items in all worlds.
- **Help Command:** Type `/clearlag24 help` to display a list of available commands and their usage instructions.

Remember that only Admins have permission to use these commands. The plugin aims to enhance server performance and maintain a smoother gameplay experience.
